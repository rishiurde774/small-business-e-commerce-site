## 2. Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>

1. **Client Side (Frontend):**
   - **User Interface (UI):** The visual part of the website that users interact with, displaying product listings, shopping carts, and checkout processes.
   - **Client-Side Framework:** Often built using a frontend framework like React.js, Vue.js, or Angular to manage the dynamic and interactive elements of the user interface.
   - **Responsive Design:** Ensures the website is accessible and functional across different devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

2. **Server Side (Backend):**
   - **Web Server:** Handles HTTP requests from clients and manages the flow of data between the client and server. Common web servers include Node.js with Express, Django, Flask, or Ruby on Rails.
   - **Application Logic:** Contains the core business logic, including user authentication, product management, order processing, and communication with external services.
   - **API (Application Programming Interface):** Defines the endpoints and methods that clients can use to interact with the server. RESTful APIs are common in e-commerce architectures.

### Backend (Node.js + Express) <a name="backend-nodejs-express"></a>


### 1. **Server Setup:**
   - The server is typically initialized in a main file, such as `server.js`.
   - It uses the `express` package to create an instance of the Express application.

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Additional server setup (middleware, error handling, etc.)

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### 2. **Middleware:**
   - Middleware functions are used to process incoming requests before they reach the route handlers.
   - Common middleware includes body parsers, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) handling, and custom middleware for authentication.

```javascript
// Middleware example
app.use(express.json()); // Parse incoming JSON requests
app.use(cors()); // Enable CORS for cross-origin requests
```

### 3. **Route Handlers:**
   - Express provides a straightforward way to define route handlers for different HTTP methods and paths.

```javascript
// Example route handler for fetching product data
app.get('/api/products', (req, res) => {
  // Logic to fetch product data from the database
  const products = fetchProductsFromDatabase();

  // Send the product data as a JSON response
  res.json(products);
});
```

### 4. **Router:**
   - For a more modular structure, routers can be used to group related routes together.

```javascript
// router.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Define routes for product-related operations
router.get('/api/products', getAllProducts);
router.get('/api/products/:productId', getProductById);
router.post('/api/products', createProduct);

module.exports = router;
```

```javascript
// server.js
const productRouter = require('./router');

// Use the product router for product-related routes
app.use(productRouter);
```

### 5. **Controller:**
   - Controllers handle the business logic for specific routes. They encapsulate the logic for fetching, creating, or updating data.

```javascript
// controller.js
const fetchProductsFromDatabase = () => {
  // Logic to fetch products from the database
};

const getAllProducts = (req, res) => {
  const products = fetchProductsFromDatabase();
  res.json(products);
};

module.exports = {
  getAllProducts,
};
```

### 6. **Database Interaction:**
   - Interactions with a database, such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL, are encapsulated within the controller functions.

```javascript
// controller.js
const ProductModel = require('./models/product');

const fetchProductsFromDatabase = async () => {
  try {
    // Example using a MongoDB model
    const products = await ProductModel.find();
    return products;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching products from the database:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### 7. **Models:**
   - Models represent the data structures and interact with the database.

```javascript
// models/product.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  price: { type: Number, required: true },
  description: { type: String },
  // Other product-related fields
});

const ProductModel = mongoose.model('Product', productSchema);

module.exports = ProductModel;
```

### 8. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling middleware to catch and respond to errors in a consistent manner.

```javascript
// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
});
```


### Database <a name="database"></a>

### Database Technology: MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format known as BSON (Binary JSON). It's well-suited for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. In an e-commerce context, MongoDB can be used to store product information, user profiles, order details, and other relevant data.

#### 1. **Database Structure:**

##### a. **Products Collection:**
   - Each product is represented as a document in the `products` collection.
   - Example product document:

   ```json
   {
     "_id": ObjectId("60214ad32b72427f5b80a1a0"),
     "name": "Example Product",
     "price": 29.99,
     "description": "A description of the product.",
     "category": "Electronics",
     "inventory": 100,
     // Other product-related fields
   }
   ```

##### b. **Users Collection:**
   - User profiles and authentication information are stored in the `users` collection.
   - Example user document:

   ```json
   {
     "_id": ObjectId("60214ad32b72427f5b80a1a1"),
     "username": "john_doe",
     "email": "john@example.com",
     "password": "hashed_password",
     // Other user-related fields
   }
   ```

##### c. **Orders Collection:**
   - Information about user orders, including the products ordered and order status, is stored in the `orders` collection.
   - Example order document:

   ```json
   {
     "_id": ObjectId("60214ad32b72427f5b80a1a2"),
     "userId": ObjectId("60214ad32b72427f5b80a1a1"),
     "products": [
       {
         "productId": ObjectId("60214ad32b72427f5b80a1a0"),
         "quantity": 2
       },
       // Other products in the order
     ],
     "total": 59.98,
     "status": "Processing",
     // Other order-related fields
   }
   ```

#### 2. **Interaction with MongoDB:**

##### a. **Using Mongoose:**
   - Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling library for Node.js. It provides a schema-based solution and simplifies interactions with MongoDB.

   ```javascript
   // models/product.js
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     name: { type: String, required: true },
     price: { type: Number, required: true },
     description: { type: String },
     category: { type: String },
     inventory: { type: Number },
     // Other product-related fields
   });

   const ProductModel = mongoose.model('Product', productSchema);

   module.exports = ProductModel;
   ```

   - Similar models would be created for the `users` and `orders` collections.

##### b. **Connecting to MongoDB:**
   - Use the `mongoose` library to connect to the MongoDB database.

   ```javascript
   // db.js
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   const { MONGO_URI } = process.env;

   mongoose.connect(MONGO_URI, {
     useNewUrlParser: true,
     useUnifiedTopology: true,
     useCreateIndex: true,
     useFindAndModify: false,
   });

   const db = mongoose.connection;

   db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'MongoDB connection error:'));
   db.once('open', () => {
     console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
   });
   ```

   - The `MONGO_URI` is the connection string for your MongoDB database.

## 8. Authentication <a name="authentication"></a>


### 1. **User Registration:**
   - When a user registers, their password is securely hashed and salted before being stored in the database.
   - A unique user ID and other relevant information are stored in the database.

### 2. **User Login:**
   - Users provide their credentials (email/username and password) to the login endpoint.
   - The backend verifies the credentials against the stored hashed password.
   - If credentials are valid, a new JWT is generated.

### 3. **JWT Generation:**
   - The backend creates a JWT containing user information (e.g., user ID, username) and a secret key.
   - The token is signed using the secret key to prevent tampering.

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const generateToken = (user) => {
  const payload = {
    userId: user._id,
    username: user.username,
    // Add more claims as needed
  };

  const options = {
    expiresIn: '1h', // Token expiration time
  };

  const secretKey = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
  const token = jwt.sign(payload, secretKey, options);
  return token;
};
```

### 4. **Token Sending to Client:**
   - The generated JWT is sent to the client, typically as a response to a successful login.

### 5. **Token Storage on the Client Side:**
   - The client stores the JWT securely, often in a cookie or localStorage.

### 6. **Authorization Header:**
   - For secured routes, the client includes the JWT in the Authorization header of each HTTP request.

```javascript
// Example using Axios for API requests in the frontend
const axios = require('axios');

const token = '...'; // Retrieve the token from storage
const headers = {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
};

axios.get('/api/protected-route', { headers })
  .then(response => {
    // Handle the response
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle authentication error
  });
```

### 7. **Middleware for Authentication:**
   - Backend routes that require authentication use middleware to verify the JWT.
   - If the JWT is valid, the middleware sets the user information in the request object for further processing.

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const authenticateUser = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.header('Authorization');

  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized: No token provided' });
  }

  jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, user) => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized: Invalid token' });
    }

    req.user = user; // Make user details available in the request object
    next();
  });
};

module.exports = authenticateUser;
```

### 8. **Protected Routes:**
   - Routes that require authentication use the `authenticateUser` middleware.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const authenticateUser = require('./authMiddleware');

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/protected-route', authenticateUser, (req, res) => {
  // Access to this route is granted only if the user is authenticated
  res.json({ message: 'You have access to this protected route!', user: req.user });
});

module.exports = router;
```

### 9. **Token Expiration:**
   - JWTs have an expiration time to enhance security.
   - The backend checks the expiration time when validating the token and denies access if it has expired.

### 10. **Token Refresh (Optional):**
   - If the token expires, the client can use a refresh token (if implemented) to obtain a new JWT without requiring the user to log in again.

### 11. **Logout:**
   - Logging out involves destroying the JWT on the client side.
   - Optionally, the backend may maintain a blacklist of revoked tokens.

### 12. **Password Reset (Optional):**
   - Users can request a password reset, triggering an email with a unique link.
   - The link contains a token allowing the user to reset their password securely.
